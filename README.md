Traffic Light Controller – Applied Physics Lab Project
📘 Project Overview
This project simulates a Traffic Light Controller system developed as part of the Applied Physics Laboratory course. The system models real-world traffic signal behavior using electronics and embedded systems concepts. It helps demonstrate timing sequences, control logic, and the application of physics in engineering design.

⚙️ Objective
To design and implement a working prototype of a traffic light controller for a four-way intersection using basic electronic components (or microcontroller, if used), timers, and logical sequencing.

🧪 Materials Used
Breadboard

LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)

Resistors

555 Timer IC (or Microcontroller, e.g., Arduino, if applicable)

Capacitors

Connecting Wires

Power Supply (5V/9V Battery or USB power)

🔄 Functionality
Cycles through red, yellow, and green lights in a fixed sequence.

Manages timing delays using a timer circuit or code-based delays.

Demonstrates a basic control system with real-time constraints.

Optional: Pedestrian crossing mode or manual override (if implemented).

🧠 Concepts Applied
Timing Circuits and Delays

Logic Sequences

Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws

Real-life Application of Electronics and Physics Principles

🧾 How to Run / Operate
Connect all components as per the circuit diagram.

Power the system using a 9V battery or USB.

Observe the LED sequence:

Red → Green → Yellow → Red ...

(Optional) Press the pedestrian button to trigger crosswalk signal mode.

✅ Expected Outcome
Properly timed and sequenced LED lights.

Smooth transitions between states.

Reliable and repeatable operation.
